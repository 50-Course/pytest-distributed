### Description

> Given when people touch on large codebases, and run pytest they burn a significant period of time in the order of hours test suites. 
> `pytest-distributed` greatly simplify that process, in hence, we are creating an alternative plugin to `pytest-xdist` 
> our plugin is focused on true parralelism of test suites.
